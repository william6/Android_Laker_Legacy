	<name>Mary Idema Pew</name>
	<bio>	Mary Idema Pew was born Mary Bonnell Idema, daughter of Steelcase, Inc. founder Walter Idema and his wife Mary. She attended Grand Rapids Public Schools and graduated from Kemper Hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin. She went on to join the U.S. Navy Women Accepted for Volunteer Experience (WAVE), where she trained pilots to use Link Flight Simulators during World War II. After two-and-a-half years in the Navy she continued to blaze trails for future generations by becoming one of the first women undergraduate students at the traditionally all-male college, Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Therefore it is appropriate that this, the first privately funded building at Grand Valley State University named for a woman, be named for her. Her husband Robert C. Pew II said, “My wife cared about education because of what it could do for peoples’ lives…her compassion was with everyday people. We know this library will benefit everyone in the region as it raises the academic achievement of Grand Valley students.”</bio>
